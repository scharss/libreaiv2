## 🚀 Recommended Models

For balanced performance, we recommend these Ollama models:

- **Mistral 7B**: Good balance between performance and speed, ideal for getting started
- **DeepSeek Coder**: Excellent for programming-related tasks
- **Qwen2.5 Coder 7B**: Good performance in general tasks and programming
- **Llama2**: Powerful option for general conversation tasks

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Cannot see Ollama models
- Make sure you have downloaded at least one model using `docker exec -it libreimagen-4-ollama-1 bash` and then `ollama pull mistral`
- Verify that both containers are running with `docker ps`
- Check the logs with `docker logs libreimagen-4-web-1`

### Web connection error
- Make sure no other service is using port 5000
- Check if the containers are running with `docker ps`
- Restart the containers: `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up -d`

### Problems with PDFs
- Make sure the PDF is not protected
- Verify that the PDF contains selectable text

### OCR Issues
- OCR works best with clear images and well-defined text
- Recognition may be limited with handwriting or unusual fonts

## 🔒 Privacy

All model inference is performed locally on your machine. No data is sent to external services, ensuring total privacy in your conversations.
